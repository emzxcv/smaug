# Authentication

```shell
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
https://api.versent.com/products?sku=moko/
```

```golang
package myservice
 
const baseURL string = "https://www.myservice.com/v1"
 
type Client struct {
	Username string
	Password string
}
 
func NewBasicAuthClient(username, password string) *Client {
	return &Client{
		Username: username,
		Password: password,
	}
}
```

The Versent API is JSON based. In order to make an authenticated call to the API, you must include your access token with the call. OAuth2 uses a BEARER token that is passed along in an Authorization header.
